# MNIST

This is the my first deep learning project after I have completed [Andrew Ng 's deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

The goal of the project is from a handwritten digit, the computer can tell which number it is. The dataset is taken from [Kaggle's Digit Recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
